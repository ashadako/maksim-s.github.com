    Always be learning

  <p>
    I'm a recent CS graduate from MIT. I enjoy reading, listening to music,
    wasting time on <a href="http://quora.com/">Quora</a>, practicing taekwondo,
    learning new cool stuff, and pretending to know something about photography
    (just because I have a DSLR). I believe that a long beach walk is the
    best way to start a day and I try to do it every weekend. One day I want to
    become a physicist. I grew up in Kyrgyzstan, but now live in San Francisco and spend most of my waking hours working at <a href="https://locu.com">Locu</a>.
