  <p>
    My name is Maksim Stepanenko and I'm a software engineer at 
    <a href="https://locu.com">Locu</a>. I grew up in Kyrgyzstan, took
    some computer science classes at <a href="http://mit.edu/">MIT</a>, and now
    live and work in San Francisco. Outside of work, I enjoy doing taekwondo,
    running, reading, pretending to know something about photography, 
    and learning new random things.
