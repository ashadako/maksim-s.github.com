      One of my resolutions for 2013 was to read more, so I decided to spend at least 30 minutes every day reading. I’ve been pretty good about keeping that up, but of course there are days when I don’t do it. Below is the list of books I’ve read since then; some of them also include links to the notes I took while reading.
