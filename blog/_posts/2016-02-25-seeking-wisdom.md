## What Influences Our Thinking?

- It is our brain, its anatomy, physiology and biochemistry and how these parts function that set the limits for how we think.
- The Brain changes continuously as a result of our experiences. Experiences produce physical changes in our brain either through new neural connections or through the generation of new neurons. 
- It’s not just what happens to us that counts — it’s what we think happens to us. We convert our expectations to a biochemical reality meaning that our mental state and physical well-being are connected.
- We are driven by our need to avoid pain and a desire to gain pleasure. Evolution has made any behavior that helps us survive and reproduce feel pleasurable or rewarding. Behavior that is bad for us feels painful or punishing.
- Harm avoidance first. Our brain is equipped to register pain more sensitively than any other emotion.
- The fear of loss is much greater than the desire to gain. We feel more pain from losing than pleasure from gaining something of equal value and we work harder to avoid losing than we do to win.
- Because of our aversion to pain we interpret choices and events in ways that make us feel better.
- What we do today is a function of what worked in the past.
- Connections between neurons determine how we think and behave. Our genes provide us with the framework for neural development and our life experiences and our environment shapes our brain. 
- Being flexible and learning a variety of options to choose from to deal with the world is of great value. This implies that finding new ways to deal with the world is superior to overtraining old patterns.
- What is our nature? It’s genes, life experiences, present environment and randomness. 
- “I always look at IQ and talent as representing the horsepower of the motor, but then in terms of the output, the efficiency with which the motor works, depends on rationality. That’s because a lot of people start out with 400-horsepower motors and get a hundred horsepower of output. It’s way better to have a  200-horsepower motor and get it all into output.” - Warren Buffett
