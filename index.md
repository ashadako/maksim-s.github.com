##### About myself:

I grew up in Kyrgyzstan. In high school, I [studied a lot of physics](http://ipho-unofficial.org/countries/KGZ/individual) and then came to the US to study more physics at MIT. That didn't happen. Instead, I got into computer science and taekwondo. These days, I live in San Francisco and work at <a href='https://coinbase.com/' target='_blank'>Coinbase</a>. In my free time I like to [read](/books), program, run, climb, and sometimes take [photos](http://photography.maksim.ms/). My current interests include: AI research, functional programming, blockchain tech, and programming languages. I still hope to go back to physics one day and maybe even learn math properly :)
