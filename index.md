I grew up in Kyrgyzstan and came to the US to study computer science at MIT. I've worked at MIT Media Lab, Google, and Locu. These days, I live in San Francisco and work at <a href='https://coinbase.com/' target='_blank'>Coinbase</a>. I like to [read](/books), <a href='https:/github.com/maksim-s' target='_blank'>program</a>, run, climb, and sometimes take [photos](http://photography.maksim.ms/).
